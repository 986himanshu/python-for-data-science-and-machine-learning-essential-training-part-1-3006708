# We will first import the streamlit and then we will show a message on a web page using streamlit. 
# {import streamlit as st}
import streamlit as st

# Next let's print the message. 
# {st.write and let's write the message hello world in it}
st.write('Hello World')

# The next step is to run this file in streamlit server to display the message in the web application. 
# For this purpose, let's open the terminal and write {streamlit run and then paste in the full file path}. So, here we can see that our web application is opened and we can see the 
# printed message hello world. I have given a complete demonstration on how to make a 
# simple web application in streamlit, and in the upcoming lectures, i will show you how we can display different types of graphs in streamlit.
